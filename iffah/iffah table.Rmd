  * I'm a homebody so I spend most of my time at home. I usually watch dramas with     genre law, medical, thriller      and suspense. I also like to learn new languages     and currently I'm learning Korean language. Even though I'm     a homebody , I also enjoy get-together with my close friends either going out to eat or          attending           any events

  * I loved reading so much. There is no reason not to love reading except the material you are reading is cliche or     something you are not interested in. I often find myself reading something related to human body such as 'Human      Atlas' or 'Fruits and Their Benefit'. It makes me understand how our body, a complex system works. 
    This makes me doubt myself for choosing Actuarial Science for my major Hahaha. Fun fact about me is that I hate      beaches. dont take me wrong; i love the scenery but i hate laying there doing nothing.
