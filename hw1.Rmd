  * Whenever I'm free, I will watch movies in my laptop. I spent a lot of my time with it and I also love                watching korean drama. Fun fact about me is I am the      8th of my 11th siblings. Also, I love doing outdoor        activities especially         hiking.

  * I'm a homebody so I spend most of my time at home. I usually watch dramas with     genre law, medical, thriller      and suspense. I also like to learn new languages     and currently I'm learning Korean language. Even though I'm     a homebody , I also enjoy get-together with my close friends either going out to eat or          attending           any events

  * People normally called me Hanim, the way to say it is like Honey with "m" at the back. My hobby I guess is the same as my generation,which is surfing internet. I love(a lot) listening to music and do some arts-y stuff or sport at the same time. However, I endorsed sleeping the most. Fun fact about me is I named my guitar "Usop", and treat him like my boyfriend. Oh, and I also run an online business.

* I loved reading so much. There is no reason not to love reading except the material you are reading is cliche or     something you are not interested in. I often find myself reading something related to human body such as 'Human      Atlas' or 'Fruits and Their Benefit'. It makes me understand how our body, a complex system works. 
    This makes me doubt myself for choosing Actuarial Science for my major Hahaha. Fun fact about me is that I hate      beaches. dont take me wrong; i love the scenery but i hate laying there doing nothing.

#R Markdown Syntax

##ii)
```{r}
x=rnorm(100, 0, 1)
```

```{r}
A=median(x)
B=mean(x)
C=var(x)
```

Empirical median of x is `r A`. 

Empirical mean of x is `r B`. 

Empirical variance of x is `r C`

The empirical value of median, mean and variance of x are different from 0, 0 and 1.

This result is not surprising as x is randomly generated from the standard normal distribution and hence the values of x are different from the standard normal distribution.

```{r}
hist(x,  main = paste("Histogram of 100 random samples from a standard normal distribution" ))
```


The histogram of x is approximately symmetrical with bell-shaped. This histogram has similar shape as the histogram of a standard normal distribution with mean=0 and standard deviation=1.


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E} [\mathrm{var}\{ v_1(\hat \theta, n) \}] &=  \mathrm{var}\{ v_1( \theta_0, n)\} 
+ \mathbb{E} [\ \mathcal{O} _p \{ \mathbf{D}_1 (\theta^*, n)(\hat \theta- \theta_0), ...,
\mathbf{D}_p (\theta^*, n)(\hat \theta- \theta_0) \}] \\
&=\mathrm{var}\{ v_1( \theta_0, n)\} + \mathcal{O} (n^{-2})
\end{aligned}
